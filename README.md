## Contracts

```ml
src
├─ Multicaller.sol — "The multicaller contract"
└─ MulticallerReader.sol — "Library to read the sender of the multicaller contract"
``` 

## Installation

You can use the [`src/MulticallerReader.sol`](./src/MulticallerReader.sol) library in your contracts to query the Multicaller efficiently.

To install with [**Foundry**](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry):

```sh
forge install vectorized/multicaller
```

To install with [**Hardhat**](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) or [**Truffle**](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle):

```sh
npm install multicaller
```

## API

### `aggregate`
```solidity
function aggregate(address[] calldata targets, bytes[] calldata data)
    external
    payable
    returns (bytes[] memory)
```  
Aggregates multiple calls in a single transaction.

The `msg.value` will be forwarded to the starting call.

### `aggregateWithSender`
```solidity
function aggregateWithSender(address[] calldata targets, bytes[] calldata data)
    external
    payable
    returns (bytes[] memory)
```  
Aggregates multiple calls in a single transaction.

The `msg.value` will be forwarded to the starting call.

This method will set `sender` to the `msg.sender` temporarily for the span of its execution.

This method does not support reentrancy.

### `sender`
```solidity
function sender() external view returns (address)
```  
Returns the address that called `aggregateWithSender` on the contract.

The value is always the zero address outside a transaction.

## Design

The contracts are designed with a priority on efficiency and minimalism. 

- Multiple input calldata arrays instead of an array of structs for more compact calldata encoding.

- Omission of utility functions like `getBlockNumber` for more efficient function dispatch. If you need those functions, just add those functions into your contract, or read them off a separate utility contract like [MakerDao's Multicall](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall).
