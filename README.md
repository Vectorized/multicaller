Efficiently call multiple contracts in a single transaction.

Allows for optional "forwarding" of `msg.sender` to the contracts called.

## Contracts

```ml
src
├─ Multicaller.sol — "The multicaller contract"
└─ MulticallerReader.sol — "Library to read the `msg.sender` of the multicaller contract"
``` 

## Installation

You can use the [`src/MulticallerReader.sol`](./src/MulticallerReader.sol) library in your contracts to query the Multicaller efficiently.

To install with [**Foundry**](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry):

```sh
forge install vectorized/multicaller
```

To install with [**Hardhat**](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) or [**Truffle**](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle):

```sh
npm install multicaller
```

## API

### Multicaller

#### `aggregate`
```solidity
function aggregate(address[] calldata targets, bytes[] calldata data)
    external
    payable
    returns (bytes[] memory)
```  
Aggregates multiple calls in a single transaction.

The `msg.value` will be forwarded to the last call.

#### `aggregateWithSender`
```solidity
function aggregateWithSender(address[] calldata targets, bytes[] calldata data)
    external
    payable
    returns (bytes[] memory)
```  
Aggregates multiple calls in a single transaction.

The `msg.value` will be forwarded to the last call.

This method will set the multicaller sender to the `msg.sender` temporarily for the span of its execution.

This method does not support reentrancy.

#### `fallback`
```solidity
fallback() external payable
```  
Returns the address that called `aggregateWithSender` on the contract.

The value is always the zero address outside a transaction.

### MulticallerReader

Library to read the `msg.sender` of the multicaller contract.

#### `multicallerSender`
```solidity
function multicallerSender() internal view returns (address)
```  
Returns the address that called `aggregateWithSender` on the multicaller.

#### `sender`
```solidity
function sender() internal view returns (address result)
```  
Returns the address that called `aggregateWithSender` on the multicaller, if `msg.sender` is the multicaller.

Otherwise, returns `msg.sender`.

## Design

The contracts are designed with a priority on efficiency and minimalism. 

- Multiple input calldata arrays instead of an array of structs for more compact calldata encoding.

- Omission of utility functions like `getBlockNumber` for more efficient function dispatch. If you need those functions, just add those functions into your contract, or read them off a separate utility contract like [MakerDao's Multicall](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall).

## Use Cases

For the following, the contracts must read the `msg.sender` from the multicaller contract.

The `MulticallerReader` library can be used for efficient reading.

- Calling access role restricted functions across multiple contracts in a single transaction. 

- Approving a trusted operator contract to transfer tokens, and then doing the transfer in a single transaction. 

  > **Warning** This will skip the approval warning on wallets. To mitigate phishing risk, you should make a custom approval function that validates a time-limited [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signature signed by the `msg.sender`.
